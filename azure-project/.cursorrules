# Azure Project Rules

## Context
This workspace focuses exclusively on Azure-related topics.

## Source Hierarchy
When answering questions about Azure:
1. **Primary**: Official Azure documentation from Microsoft Learn
2. **Secondary**: PDF documents in the `azure-docs/` folder
3. **Tertiary**: Azure best practices and architectural patterns
4. **Last resort**: General cloud computing knowledge

## Guidelines
- Prioritize Azure-native solutions
- Reference specific Azure services and features
- Cite official Microsoft documentation when possible
- When PDFs are available, reference them specifically

## Document Organization
- All Azure reference PDFs should be in `azure-docs/`
- Maintain consistency with Azure naming conventions
- Use Azure terminology and service names accurately
